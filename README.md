**TechDome DevOps Assignment**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on deploying a multi-container application using Docker for local development and Kubernetes for production-grade deployment. The application consists of a frontend, backend, and a PostgreSQL database, which are containerized using Docker. The project also covers deploying these containers in a local Kubernetes cluster managed by Minikube.

By the end of this project, the frontend and backend services will be deployed on Kubernetes, with the database running in a containerized environment. The application will be accessible locally.

**Prerequisites**

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed:

Git: For cloning repositories.
Docker: For containerizing the application.
Docker Compose: For running multi-container applications locally.
Minikube: For running a local Kubernetes cluster.
Kubectl: For interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
AWS CLI: If deploying to AWS (optional).

**Steps**
Step 1: Set Up the AWS Instance and Docker
Create an AWS EC2 Instance:

Log in to your AWS console, launch an Ubuntu instance, and configure security groups, instance type, and key pair.
SSH into the AWS Instance:

Use SSH to connect to the instance and run commands to install Docker and Docker Compose.
Clone the Project Repositories:

Clone the frontend and backend repositories from GitHub into the TechDemo-Assignment directory.
Create Dockerfiles:

Write the Dockerfile for both the frontend and backend applications to containerize the services.
Build Docker Images:

Build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend using the Dockerfiles created in the previous step.
Create a Docker Compose File:

Write a docker-compose.yml file to link the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL services.
Update the database connection settings in the backend application to point to the PostgreSQL service.
Build and Run Docker Containers:

Use the docker-compose up --build command to build and run the containers locally.
Push Docker Images to Docker Hub:

After successfully building the images, tag and push them to Docker Hub for later use in Kubernetes.
Step 2: Deploy to Kubernetes with Minikube
Install Minikube and Kubectl:

Install Minikube and Kubectl on your local machine. Use PowerShell (on Windows) to install Minikube and Kubectl.
Start Minikube:

Run the minikube start command to start the local Kubernetes cluster.
Create Kubernetes Deployment Files:

Write deployment manifest files for each service (frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL).
These files define the configuration for each service, including containers, environment variables, ports, and volumes.
Deploy the Application to Minikube:

Use the kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yml, kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yml, kubectl apply -f postgre-deployment.yml command to deploy the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL services to the Kubernetes cluster.
Expose Services via Kubernetes:

Expose the frontend service using kubectl expose to make it accessible via an external IP or port.
Configure NodePort or LoadBalancer for exposing the services.
Access the Application Locally:

Use kubectl port-forward to forward the ports of the frontend service to your local machine.
Once the port is forwarded, access the application via http://localhost:3000.
Deployment Verification
After running the kubectl apply commands for each service, verify that the services are correctly deployed by checking the Kubernetes pods and services.
If everything is deployed correctly, open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend of the TechDome application.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have successfully:

Containerized the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL services using Docker.
Deployed the services to a Minikube Kubernetes cluster for local development.
Exposed the frontend service via kubectl port-forward and accessed it in your browser.
This approach leverages Docker and Kubernetes to create a scalable and portable environment for the TechDome application, ensuring that it can be easily deployed and managed in both local and production environments.
